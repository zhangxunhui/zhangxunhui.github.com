Hello everyone! I'm an assistant professor in Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDL), National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China.

My main research interests are measuring developer contribution in OSS, code clone detection and blockchain based OSS intellectual property protection.

I like music and basketball.
