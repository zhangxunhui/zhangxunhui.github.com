Hello everyone! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDL), National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China. From 2018 to 2022 (expected).

I joined the [Trustie & OSSEAN](https://www.trustie.net) Group at September 2015, advised by Prof. [Huaimin Wang](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huaimin). Before that I graduated with a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University in 2015.

My main research interests are measuring developer contribution in OSS, code clone detection and blockchain based OSS copyright protection. Before that I have worked on the developer behavior analysis and recommendation, and automatic code summarization and code search.

I like music and basketball.
